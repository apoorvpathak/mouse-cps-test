# Mouse CPS Test


A simple mouse click speed test website inspired by my love of Minecraft PvP(mainly Bedwars).

This is `v1.0.0`.

I made this very simple and basic project using `TailwindCSS`, `HTML`, `JavaScript`.

This small project is deployed with Netlify [here.](https://mouse-cps-test.netlify.app/)

_You are free to use any part of the project in any way you want if it's useful to you as long as I am not liable for anything that happens as a result of you using this code._
